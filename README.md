# Welcome to My Flask Web App!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share with you my web application built with Flask. 
AI music generation app using Google Colab and Flask, featuring a TensorFlow LSTM model for classical music compositions. 
Offers a Flask web interface for real-time music creation. Combines deep learning, music theory, and cloud tech.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the code, let's make sure you're all set up:

### Prerequisites

- You should have Python installed on your machine. I've used Python 3.10 for this project, so anything from that version upwards should work fine.

### Setting Up Flask

Installing Flask is a breeze! Just fire up your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install flask
